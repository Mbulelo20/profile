                            My name is Mbulelo Pani. I'm a web developer from Cape Town.
                            I enjoy working on projects that challenge my critical thinking and require a little bit of imagination,
                            from authentication and databases, to forms and animations.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                            I was first interested in programming during college, where I was studying Logical Systems.
                            I then pursued this interest when I took a brief programming course, and during that time
                            I also volunteered at a career expo NGO where I was an assistant, introducing basic programming to high school pupils.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                            I started a fullstack web development course at Lifechoices, graduating the same year, 2020. I gained experience in studying and
                            working alone, but I also gained valuable experience working within a team.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                            I enjoy the time being in a team, sharing ideas and solutions and trouble shooting. Outside my work, my interests include robotics, physics and gaming.
